Linearity of a function
An operator H is linear if : 
Additivity
Multiplicative scaling (because of these values, filtering processes are going to be linear).

Impulse of function response
Impulse - building block of function: a small signal whose area is 1. 
Impulse response helps us to describe the function of the black box or function. 
When applying filter with intensity 1,for example, the image is with the filter flipped reverse and updown flip also.
