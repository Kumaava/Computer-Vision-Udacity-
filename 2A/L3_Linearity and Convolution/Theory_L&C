Linearity of a function
An operator H is linear if : 
Additivity
Multiplicative scaling (because of these values, filtering processes are going to be linear).
-----

Impulse of function response  ( When your filter with an impulse, you get no change)
and shifting the impulse gets a shifted function. 
Impulse - building block of function: a small signal whose area is 1. 
Impulse response helps us to describe the function of the black box or function. 
When applying filter with intensity 1,for example, the image is with the filter flipped reverse and updown flip also.   

Suppose our kernel is size M*M and image as size N*N, how many multiplies to filter the whole image?
M*M*N*N
-----

Correlation vs Convolution (linear operators) - commutative, associative, Identity and Differentiation. 
Correlation is when applying the filter and in covolution your image is flipped updown and left right.
or in Convolution: you flip your kernel before applying and updating it. (image updated)

Shift invariant if required for the convolution process, Shift invariant behaves everywhere the same way i.e. the value 
depends on pattern in the neighborhood, not the position of the neighborhood.

Computational complexity and separability (linearly seperable filter)
When making a kernel for convolving a row vector by a column vector and also they are linearly separable,
this is called separability. 
we get the order of magnitude(imp.)

Boundary Issues : full, same, valid (types, image updated)

method
- clip filter (assuming the boundary is black)
- wrap around (fourier analysis - the image continues and wraps around)
- copy edge - just copy out the same value form a limit.  
- reflect across edge ( symmetric): reflects across the edge. (all image updated)
Reflect method of handling the boundary conditions is good as the created imagery has the same statistics as the original 
image.

Median Filter : remove noise by blurring the image.
