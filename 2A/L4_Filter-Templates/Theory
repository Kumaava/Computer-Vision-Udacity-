1D Correlation

- Normalised correlation between filter and Signal for find the pattern (similar to 'find' function in python String Theory). 

Template Matching : normxcorr2 

Where's Waldo?  - template matching in 2D images 

what is it good for? - 

Non-identical pattern matching - thus using filters as templates. 

Sometimes we may not have a good template and thus using normalized pattern matching is not very good.
