Noise is just another function in the Image that is combined with another function to get another function:
I'(x, y) = I(x,y) + N(x,y)

Types - 

Salt and pepper ; random occurences of black and white pixels.

Impluse Noise ; random occurences of white pixels.

Gaussian Noise ; Variations in intensity drawn from a Guassian Normal Distribution. 
noise = randm(size(img)).* sigma ; 
output = img + noise ;
