Noise is just another function in the Image that is combined with another function to get another function:
I'(x, y) = I(x,y) + N(x,y)

Noise is random things scaled by sigma. 

Types - 
Salt and pepper ; random occurences of black and white pixels.

Impluse Noise ; random occurences of white pixels.

Gaussian Noise ; Variations in intensity drawn from a Guassian Normal Distribution. 
noise = randm(size(img)).* sigma ; 
output = img + noise ; 
----------------- 
Image Difference : Unit 8 is [0,255] and in absolute difference the value gets truncated (i.e. -ve value is 0)
-----------------
sigma(Ïƒ) increases _ Gaussian Noise Increases. (image added)
