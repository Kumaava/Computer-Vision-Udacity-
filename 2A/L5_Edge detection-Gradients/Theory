what are the things to capture in an image. 

An edge is a place of rapid change in the image intensity function. 
Edges are important : 
surface normal discontinuity
depth discontinuity
surface color discontinuity
Illumination discontinuit

Derivatives And Edges : 

differential operator : When applied to an Image, returns some derivative, 
-these operator are masks/kernels that compute image gradient function &
-threshold the gradient function to select the edge pixel.

Gradient : it is a vector that is made up of derivates.
Magnitude : how quickly things are getting brighter 

when Image gradient is zero - image is constant, at maximum or at a minimum. 

-----------------

To find edges we require partial derivative that can take steps in specific directions and also require
multivariate calculus to check if the change is in x or y direction. 
for as we make gradients and we require a mask or kernel that implement these gradients. 

the Discrete gradient : A good operator should have a middle value to find the symmetry.  

Sobel Operator : scale value by dividing it by 8. 
Gardient magnitude
Thershold gradient magnitude.

Different operators : 
Sobel
Prewitt
Roberts

Correlation preserves the intended directionality of gradients. 
"imfilter" command(used in code used bydefault correlation so if you want to use convolution (code explicitly). 

Reducing the noise will help get the derivative peak after implimenting the derivative operator. 

Associative and commutative property help take the derivative of the kernel and then apply to the signal.
