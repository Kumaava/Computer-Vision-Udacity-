Averaging Assumptions - 
The true value of pixel is equal to the value of pixels nearby. 
The noise added to each pixel is done independently (thus taking avrg is the right thing to do). 
----------------------

Weighted moving average ; the more nearby a pixel is the more weight it will have(non-uniform weight). 
-To do the moving average computation, the number of weights should be odd- makes it easier to have a 
middle value. 
- helps get a normalised distrbution of pixels (image added)
