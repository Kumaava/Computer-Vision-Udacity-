Averaging Assumptions - 
The true value of pixel is equal to the value of pixels nearby. 
The noise added to each pixel is done independently (thus taking avrg is the right thing to do). 
----------------------

Weighted moving average ; the more nearby a pixel is the more weight it will have(non-uniform weight). 
-To do the moving average computation, the number of weights should be odd- makes it easier to have a 
middle value. 
- helps get a normalised distrbution of pixels (smooth) (image added)
the math on which moving average is based on is called correlation filtering (with Uniform weights)
------------

Correlation filtering  :  Uniform and non unifrom weights (updated in image).
The filter "kernel or mask" H[u,v] is the matrix of weights in linear combination. 

Averaging filter =  F(x,y) * H(u,v) = G(x,y) (Image added) - a box filter 
is used that is a sqaure matrix of 9(row * col) each 1. [used for smoothing]
----------------

Guassian filter ; higher in the middle, fall off at the corners and even lower at the edges (image added)
Nearest Neighbour pixels have the most influence. 
DOING A SMOOTHING PROPORTIONAL TO THE EQUATION - isotropic gaussian (circulary symmetric) (image Updated)

NOTE : With a non-gaussian filter : we get sharp edges and with Gaussian you get smooth blur image. 

Sigma with 2,5 can have the same size of filter & bigger sigma is better ( more smooth)
